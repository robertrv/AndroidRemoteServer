This is a port and trying to update the current work done in 
http://code.google.com/p/androidremote-server/

Introduction
============

This server is used in combination with AndroidRemoteClient.

The idea is to manage remotely the device, likely to install, manage, 
start-stop new applications.

The workflow is like follows:
 - You install the current application (AndroidRemoteServer.apk) inside any 
 android device (see dependencies)
 - Then you can start the server in order to listen for VNC connections.
 - 

Dependencies
============

In order to execute it you need a rooted device with busybox
 (http://busybox.net/) available on your path.
 
The VNC server is based on http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/ which is used 
with android NDK to execute it.
