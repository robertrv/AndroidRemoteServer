This is a port and trying to update the current work done in 
http://code.google.com/p/androidremote-server/

Introduction
============

This server is used in combination with AndroidRemoteClient.

The idea is to manage remotely the device, likely to install, manage, 
start-stop new applications.

The workflow is like follows:
 - You install the current application (AndroidRemoteServer.apk) inside any 
 android device (see dependencies)
 - Then you can start the server in order to listen for VNC connections.
 - 

Dependencies
============

In order to execute it you need a rooted device with busybox
 (http://busybox.net/) available on your path.
 
The VNC server is based on droid vnc server [1] which is based  on libvncserver 
[2] which is compiled using with android NDK to execute it. We just include 
the executable itself. 

Use
===

In order to use you need an Android rooted device or the Android emulator. In 
case of an Android rooted device just have to install and execute. 
In case of Android emulator, you can use
	prepare.sh ${avd} # Should be executed from project home folder
And then just install the AndroidRemoteServer.apk directly and execute it.

Once is executing simply you can execute the AndroidRemoteClient and connect to 
localhost with default port (5901). Also you can connect through any VPN client
to the server through localhost and the previous port.
